# Brief
This is a hobby project, to make a copy of HHKB. 
I cannot say it can easily be reproducable, 
since different people have different tools and machines.
I will just leave the specific procedures for my setup.
Below is the hardwares and materials I used.

* [Shapeoko1](https://www.shapeoko.com/shapeoko1.html) with GRBL controller and limit switch at -X, +Y.
* [Master mechanic rotary tool](https://www.amazon.com/Jinding-Group-152294-Mechanic-100-Pieces/dp/B00AV95RWQ) .
* A 3D printer
* End mill with 6mm and 1mm of diameter.
* 330x130x34mm black walnut block.

# Build
Although the repository is shipped with final toolpaths files but they can be 
regenerated by following steps.

## Requirements (for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)
Install latest development version of OpenSCAD.

    wget -qO - http://files.openscad.org/OBS-Repository-Key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-get install openscad-nightly

Download the source
    git clone https://github.com/jinhwanlazy/diy_hhkb
    cd diy_hhkb

I used [PyCam](https://github.com/SebKuzminsky/pycam) to convert STL model to
gcode. But both version 0.6 and v0.5.1. Because v0.6 generally performs better,
but it failed to produce proper toolpath in some cases.

    sudo apt-get install python-gtk2 python-opengl python-gtkglext1 python-rsvg python-pyode python-guppy
    wget https://github.com/SebKuzminsky/pycam/archive/v0.6.tar.gz
    tar xvzf v0.6.tar.gz
    wget https://github.com/SebKuzminsky/pycam/archive/v0.5.1.tar.gz
    tar xvzf v0.5.1.tar.gz

And following command will generate stls and toolpathes under stl and gcode
drectory.
    
    make

# Customization
## Parameters
`model` directory has CAD model of the case. 
It can be converted to STL format 3D model by [OpenSCAD](www.openscad.org/). 
Some parts of the case shape are parameterized, 
for example, tilt angle and overall height, and roundness.
You can modifiy it in `model/shepe.sacd` file.

## Layout
The layout of the keyboard can be changed. 
`layout` directory contains files with
[keyboard-layout-editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/)
compatible layout data. If you want build with your own layout, copy 
Raw data from http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ and make a file with it.
You can feed one of the layout by following command.

    python3 layout_parser.py layout/hhkb.layout > model/params.scad

## Toolpath generation
Makefile has settings for each tasks. 
You have to manually modify the file to match your machine.
Or your can use any CAM software of your preference.

## Requirements

# Machine
I have a shapeoko
